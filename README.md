## 🎯 Overview

I design and build **production-ready automation systems in n8n** that connect:

## 🧾 Additional Private Business Use Cases

Beyond the projects above, I design custom n8n automations for **private and field-based businesses**, such as:

- HVAC and maintenance companies  
- Home services (cleaning, repairs, technicians)  
- Small agencies and local service providers  

Typical patterns:

- Centralising all WhatsApp / Instagram inquiries into Google Sheets (as a simple CRM).  
- Automatic status tracking: **New → In progress → Done → Paid**.  
- Reminder and follow-up flows so no lead, job, or payment is forgotten.
